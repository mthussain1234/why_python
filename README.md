# Why Python

## Why is Python so popular?

Python is popular for many reasons some of which include:

* **Accessible**
  * There are many resources available for Python, ranging from tutorials and online code academies
  * Python generally has a simple syntax
    * This makes it easy for beginners to read and learn
* **Flexibility, Scalability, Versatility**
  * Python is generally a flexible language
    * Used in both small scripts and large scale applications
    * From this we can deduce that scaling up and down when needed is easy
    * Python is also used for a variety of applications, eg: web development, data analysis, machine learning
* **Community**
  * The community of developers who use Python is large and very supportive
  * Numerous developers contribute to the open-source libraries and frameworks
    * allows for collaboration when working on difficult and complex applications


## Different ways Python is used?

### Machine Learning

Python is widely used for machine learning and AI.

It has a variety of libraries: 
* **TensorFlow** - rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system
* **PyTorch** -  framework for building deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning, commonly used in applications like image recognition.
* **scikit-learn** - provides a selection of  tools for machine learning and statistical modelling

The popularity within machine learning is due to the simplicity and ease of use.

Mainly supported by the wide range of tools and libraries that are available for machine learning tasks.


### Programming

As said before, Python is a programming language, that is easy to read and write.

### Scripting

Python can be used for automating repetitive tasks such as:

* File Processing
* System Administration

As we have said before, the simplicity of python and the fact that is easy to read and write, make it a more than viable choice to write scripts.
The simple syntax, and variety of libraries add on to the fact that Python is great for scripting.

## Who is using Python?

In short all the big companies are using Python to achieve their objectives. Some reasons for this are versatility and ease of use.

These reasons make it a popular choice for a variety of projects.

Some companies that use Python:

* **Google** : Google statistically are the biggest users of Python using it for: web crawling, data analysis, and machine learning
* **Amazon** : Amazon uses Python for web development, cloud automation, and data analysis
* **Spotify** : Spotify uses Python specifically for their music recommendation system
  * It uses machine learning algorithms to suggest songs to the user based on their previously listened.

## Why is python in demand as a skill?

* Versatility - Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications
* Ease of use - easy to learn, syntax is simple and intuitive
* Python is one of the most popular programming languages
* As big data and machine learning, Python has become an increasingly popular language for data analysis and machine learning tasks

## Salaries for Python Skilled professionals

The average python developer salary in the United Kingdom is £57,500 per year or £29.49 per hour. Entry level positions start at £45,000 per year while most experienced workers make up to £80,000 per year

## Why is Python used in DevOps?

* Automation
  * Python is popular for automation due to its ease of use, readability. This makes it
an ideal choice to write scripts for automation
* IaC - Python is used for provisioning and configuring infrastructure resources
  * Pythons libraries and modules (eg: Ansible, Terraform, AWS SDK)
    * These make it easy to automate these tasks
* Testing - Testing frameworks such as Pytest and Unittest exist
  * These allow DevOps teams to write/execute tests on their code
* Community Support - Python has a  large community which is also very active
  * This also means there are tons of resources available for DevOps teams
    * Ranging from forums, libraries and tutorials
