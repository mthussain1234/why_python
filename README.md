# Why Python

## Why is Python so popular?

Python is popular for many reasons some of which include:

* **Accessible**
  * There are many resources available for Python, ranging from tutorials and online code academies
  * Python generally has a simple syntax
    * This makes it easy for beginners to read and learn
* **Flexibility, Scalability, Versatility**
  * Python is generally a flexible language
    * Used in both small scripts and large scale applications
    * From this we can deduce that scaling up and down when needed is easy
    * Python is also used for a variety of applications, eg: web development, data analysis, machine learning
* **Community**
  * The community of developers who use Python is large and very supportive
  * Numerous developers contribute to the open-source libraries and frameworks
    * allows for collaboration when working on difficult and complex applications


## Different ways Python is used?

### Machine Learning

Python is widely used for machine learning and AI.

It has a variety of libraries: 
* **TensorFlow** - rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system
* **PyTorch** -  framework for building deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning, commonly used in applications like image recognition.
* **scikit-learn** - provides a selection of  tools for machine learning and statistical modelling

The popularity within machine learning is due to the simplicity and ease of use.

Mainly supported by the wide range of tools and libraries that are available for machine learning tasks.


### Programming

As said before, Python is a programming language, that is easy to read and write.

### Scripting

Python can be used for automating repetitive tasks such as:

* File Processing
* System Administration

As we have said before, the simplicity of python and the fact that is easy to read and write, make it a more than viable choice to write scripts.
The simple syntax, and variety of libraries add on to the fact that Python is great for scripting.

## Who is using Python?

In short all the big companies are using Python to achieve their objectives. Some reasons for this are versatility and ease of use.

These reasons make it a popular choice for a variety of projects.

Some companies that use Python:

* **Google** : Google statistically are the biggest users of Python using it for: web crawling, data analysis, and machine learning
* **Amazon** : Amazon uses Python for web development, cloud automation, and data analysis
* **Spotify** : Spotify uses Python specifically for their music recommendation system
  * It uses machine learning algorithms to suggest songs to the user based on their previously listened.
